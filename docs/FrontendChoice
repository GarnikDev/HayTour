I chose React as frontend technology for several reasons:

1. I already have basic knoledge of React.
2. React helps to have fully separated frontend environment.
3. It's fully compatible with Spring.
4. It has a very big range of libraries.
5. (Maybe the most important point) it allows to have minimal logic directly from the frontend code itself.
