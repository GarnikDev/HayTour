## Branch strategy (GitHub Flow Simplified)

- main: Final stable code.
- develop: Features integration.
- feature/*: One per task/issue. Ex: feature/#15-user-stories.

Flow:
1. Create featuer branch from develop/main.
2. Develop and commit.
3. Open PR to develop/main.
4. Merge and delete the branch.
